# 💻 Tech stack

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for Mobile app
- [Ethers.js](https://ethers.org/) for client blockchain
- [Infura](https://infura.io/) for API blockchain

# 🚀 Getting Started

##### 1. Clone proyect:

```bash
git clone ...
cd ...
```

<!-- ##### 2. Create `.env.local` file:

```bash
INFURA_TOKEN_API = 'API KEY from Infura'
CRYPTO_SECRET_KEY = 'KEY random for encrypt/decrypt'
``` -->

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
